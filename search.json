    "text": "What is Holos\nThe Holos model estimates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and changes in soil carbon content on Canadian farms, helping users explore ways to reduce emissions and increase soil carbon content. Users can input farm-specific data and adjust management practices such as livestock diets or farming practices. The model utilizes climate, soil, and agronomic data to calculate emissions from a variety of sources, including crops, livestock, and energy use. Documentation and FAQs are available on GitHub Learn more\n\n\nWhat is PyHolos\nPyHolos is a model that integrates the Holos greenhouse gas emissions calculation module into the LiteFarm framework, specifically focusing on nitrous oxide (ùëÅ2ùëÇ) emissions from crop residues. It enhances the original Holos model to provide more accurate calculations of ùëÅ2ùëÇ emissions related to crop residue management.\n\n\n\nPyHolos Structure\n\n\n\n\nGoal\nOur project will work to enhance the existing emissions model, PyHolos, by incorporating plot-level interventions and increasing the dynamicity of the model parameters, with the hope of making the model more applicable to different regions. Throughout this process we aim to base our work in agroecological and agronomic principles, while also contemplating farmer accessibility and implementation. Specifically, we intend to achieve the following objectives:\nUpdate the existing PyHolos model to increase the dynamicity of the model equations, making sure to reinforce this work with agronomic principles. The initial focus will be on expanding across Canada, then to other regions of the world.\nUtilize experimental data from the UBC farm as a test bed for the PyHolos model to better inform model parameters. For instance, we hope to draw on the cause-and-effect relationships established through the numerous agricultural experiments conducted at the UBC Farm to help us identify the emission contributions generated by specific farming inputs and practices."

    "text": "Sofia\nTo date, I have focused my attention to two main areas:\n\nReserach to determine variables which may be helpful for our own modelling purposes, to request from the UBC Farm databases.\n\n\nIn item 1, I have been accessing LCA databses to see the network of inputs/outputs that certain crop farming practices require. Currently I have been exploring potato farming, in the LCA Commons database of the USDA. I believe that since LCA databases are highly utilized, I would be able to find reliable information that could be similar to what is contained at the UBC Farm databases.\n\nNext, I aim to conduct a simple LCA model of potato farming using OpenLCA with the ecoinvent database. This will provide a detailed diagram of all the inputs/outputs that can inform our own data needs. Likley the LCA databses contain far more data than we will be able to have from the UBC Farm, but it is a very good start for our data gathering, alongside with literaeture review that is being done by me peers.\n\nFurther looking at comparisons of the model outputs coming from HOLOS and PyHOLOS.\n\n\nIn item 2, I have begun to go through some JSON files with my peer Anny. These files contain the resultant values from the HOLOS models which we are comparing to the PyHOLOS model output. We noticed that there are discrpanicies between model results for the same input crops. In order to detect differences more easily, we decided to creeate a JSON decoder, to transform the JSON file into a more readable format. This could be something that we could ‚Äúteach‚Äù our group memebrs about to allow for others to help us with this task once the decoder is working."

What model outputs are needed from PyHolos to give farmers the information they need?

    "text": "What is Holos\nThe Holos model estimates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and changes in soil carbon content on Canadian farms, helping users explore ways to reduce emissions and increase soil carbon content. Users can input farm-specific data and adjust management practices such as livestock diets or farming practices. The model utilizes climate, soil, and agronomic data to calculate emissions from a variety of sources, including crops, livestock, and energy use. Documentation and FAQs are available on GitHub Learn more\n\n\nWhat is PyHolos\nPyHolos is a model that integrates the Holos greenhouse gas emissions calculation module into the LiteFarm framework, specifically focusing on nitrous oxide (ùëÅ2ùëÇ) emissions from crop residues. It enhances the original Holos model to provide more accurate calculations of ùëÅ2ùëÇ emissions related to crop residue management.\n\n\n\nPyHolos Structure\n\n\n\n\nGoal\nOur project will work to enhance the existing emissions model, PyHolos, by incorporating plot-level interventions and increasing the dynamicity of the model parameters, with the hope of making the model more applicable to different regions. Throughout this process we aim to base our work in agroecological and agronomic principles, while also contemplating farmer accessibility and implementation. Specifically, we intend to achieve the following objectives:\nUpdate the existing PyHolos model to increase the dynamicity of the model equations, making sure to reinforce this work with agronomic principles. The initial focus will be on expanding across Canada, then to other regions of the world.\nUtilize experimental data from the UBC farm as a test bed for the PyHolos model to better inform model parameters. For instance, we hope to draw on the cause-and-effect relationships established through the numerous agricultural experiments conducted at the UBC Farm to help us identify the emission contributions generated by specific farming inputs and practices."
